---------------------------------------

Upgrades Visual Studio 2017 projects to use PackageReferences instead of packages.config, streamlining package resolution and eliminating errors.

See the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) for changes and road map.

## Features

- Upgrades VS2017 projects by moving NuGet package references into the project file itself.

### Project Upgrade:
- Creates a backup of your packages.config and project file for safekeeping.
- Cycles through your packages.config file for your existing references.
- Removes the legacy package-relative DLL references.
- Removes legacy .targets import nodes, as PackageReferences handle them transparently.
- Removes legacy error conditions.
